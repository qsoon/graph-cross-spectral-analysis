# Cross-spectral analysis of bivariate graph signals

This repo contains the source code for cross-spectral analysis on graphs.


## Description

- Code
  - `utils.R` is a code for functions used for cross-spectral analysis and visualization.
  - `simulation.R` is a code for simulation study.
  - `realdata.R` is a code for real data analysis.

- Data
  - `seoulmetro` contains data of daily number of people getting on and off the Seoul Metropolitan Subway in South Korea.
  - `stationary` contains meteorological dataset collected hourly during January 2014 in Brest, France.  

## Code overview
We present a cross-spectral analysis method for bivariate graph signals, applying it to diverse simulation scenarios and real-world dataset.
